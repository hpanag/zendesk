# Ticket Dashboard - Mixed Chart + Table

## Overview
The `tickets.html` page now displays **both** a mixed chart AND a detailed table showing ticket status trends over the last 7 days.

## Chart Components

### 1. Line Chart (Blue)
**Total Active Tickets** = Sum of:
- New
- Open  
- Pending
- Solved

This shows the overall workload/active ticket count per day.

### 2. Bar Charts
- **Red Bars** = New Tickets created each day
- **Green Bars** = Closed Tickets each day

The bar chart shows the daily influx (new) vs resolution (closed) rate.

## Chart Features

✅ **Mixed chart type** - Combines line and bar charts
✅ **Smooth line curve** - Easy to follow trends
✅ **Color coded**:
   - Blue line = Total active tickets
   - Red bars = New tickets
   - Green bars = Closed tickets
✅ **Interactive legend** - Click to show/hide series
✅ **Tooltips** - Hover to see exact values
✅ **Responsive** - Adapts to screen size

## Table Features

✅ **Detailed breakdown** - Shows all 6 status types per day
✅ **Sorted newest first** - Most recent day at top
✅ **Total column** - Sum of all ticket activity
✅ **Striped rows** - Easy to read
✅ **Number formatting** - Comma separators

## Data Interpretation

### Total Active Tickets (Line)
Shows your team's current workload. A rising line means tickets are accumulating faster than they're being closed.

### New vs Closed (Bars)
- **Red higher than Green** = More tickets created than closed (backlog growing)
- **Green higher than Red** = More tickets closed than created (backlog shrinking)
- **Equal height** = Balanced (maintaining current backlog level)

## Example Data (from your system)

### October 10, 2025
- **Total Active**: 372 tickets (47 new + 68 open + 31 pending + 226 solved)
- **New**: 47 (red bar)
- **Closed**: 642 (green bar)
- **Net**: -595 tickets (good! reducing backlog)

### October 9, 2025
- **Total Active**: 388 tickets (0 new + 28 open + 14 pending + 346 solved)
- **New**: 0 (red bar)
- **Closed**: 156 (green bar)
- **Net**: -156 tickets (reducing backlog)

### October 8, 2025
- **Total Active**: 578 tickets (7 new + 13 open + 20 pending + 538 solved)
- **New**: 7 (red bar)
- **Closed**: 267 (green bar)
- **Net**: -260 tickets (strong performance)

## Technical Details

### Chart Configuration
- **Type**: Mixed (line + bar)
- **Height**: 400px
- **Library**: ApexCharts
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions enabled
- **Stroke width**: 3px for line, default for bars
- **Column width**: 50% for bars

### Data Calculation

**Total Active Tickets Formula:**
```javascript
totalActive = new + open + pending + solved
```

**Why solved is included:**
Solved tickets are still "active" until they're permanently closed. They can be reopened if needed.

**Why hold is excluded:**
Hold tickets are technically active but this formula focuses on tickets in the normal workflow.

### Color Scheme
- **#206bc4** (Blue) - Total Active (primary color)
- **#d63939** (Red) - New Tickets (warning/alert)
- **#2fb344** (Green) - Closed Tickets (success/completion)

## Business Insights

### Rising Total Active Line
**Problem**: Backlog is growing
**Action**: Need more agents or faster resolution

### Falling Total Active Line  
**Good Sign**: Team is catching up, backlog shrinking
**Sustain**: Maintain current capacity

### Red Bars Consistently Higher Than Green
**Problem**: Creating tickets faster than closing them
**Action**: 
- Increase capacity
- Improve self-service
- Reduce ticket volume at source

### Green Bars Consistently Higher Than Red
**Excellent**: Tickets being resolved faster than created
**Result**: Eventually will catch up to zero backlog
