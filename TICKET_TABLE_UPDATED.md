# Ticket Status Table View - Updated

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated execView.js
**Changed data structure** from:
```json
"tickets": {
  "openTickets": [...],
  "closedTickets": [...]
}
```

**To:**
```json
"tickets": {
  "byStatus": [
    {
      "date": "2025-10-05",
      "new": 0,
      "open": 0,
      "pending": 0,
      "hold": 0,
      "solved": 0,
      "closed": 402
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 2. Updated tickets.html
**Replaced:** Bar chart visualization with ApexCharts

**With:** HTML table showing all ticket statuses per day

## Table Columns

| **Date** | Full date with day of week (e.g., "Mon, Oct 7, 2025") |

## How to Use

### Generate Data:
```bash
node execView.js
```

### View Table:
Open `web/tickets.html` in your browser

### Update Frequency:
- Run daily for fresh data
- Script captures last 7 days automatically
- Each row shows ticket statuses at end of that day

## Understanding the Data

### What Each Status Means:
- **New**: Tickets just created, not yet assigned
- **Open**: Tickets actively being worked on
- **Pending**: Waiting for customer response or external action
- **Hold**: Temporarily paused tickets
- **Solved**: Tickets marked as resolved (can be reopened)
- **Closed**: Permanently closed tickets (cannot be reopened)

### Total Column:
The total represents all tickets that were **updated** or **changed status** on that day, not necessarily created on that day.

### Zero Values:
Some statuses show 0, which means no tickets moved to that status on that particular day. This is normal, especially for weekends (Oct 5-6) or early morning hours (Oct 11).

## Technical Notes

### Data Source:
- Uses Zendesk Incremental Tickets API
- Filters by `updated_at` timestamp
- Counts tickets that had each specific status at end of day

### Rate Limiting:
- Script respects 1 request per second limit
- May skip most recent day if rate limit hit
- Re-run script to complete missing data

### Browser Compatibility:
- Works in all modern browsers
- No chart library needed (removed ApexCharts)
- Pure JavaScript table rendering
- Falls back gracefully if data unavailable

## Files Modified

1. **execView.js** - Updated `generateTicketTrends()` to collect all status types
2. **web/tickets.html** - Replaced chart with table layout
3. **data/execView.json** - New structure with `byStatus` array

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Color coding** - Add status badges (green for solved/closed, yellow for pending, etc.)
2. **Sorting** - Allow clicking column headers to sort
3. **Filtering** - Add date range picker
4. **Export** - Add CSV export button
5. **Trends** - Add delta/change indicators (↑↓) showing increase/decrease from previous day
6. **Charts** - Add mini sparkline charts in cells
7. **Totals row** - Add footer row with sum of each column
8. **Percentage view** - Toggle to show percentages instead of counts
