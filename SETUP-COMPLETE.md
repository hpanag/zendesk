# ✅ Setup Complete - Zendesk Executive Dashboard

## 🎉 What's Been Configured

Your Zendesk Executive Dashboard is now fully automated and ready to track metrics daily!

### ✅ Automated Data Collection
- **Scheduled Task**: `Zendesk-ExecView-Daily` runs every night at **11:30 PM**
- **What it collects**:
  - 📊 Current ticket status counts (snapshot at end of day)
  - 📞 Voice call metrics (weekdays only)
- **Data storage**: `data/execView.json` (persistent, never deleted)

### ✅ Current Status (as of Oct 12, 2025)

Your system currently has **1 day** of ticket snapshot data:

**October 12, 2025 (Saturday) - Ticket Status:**
- New: **113**
- Open: **145**
- Pending: **67**
- Hold: **65**
- Solved: **848**  
- **Total Active: 390** (new + open + pending + solved)

This represents the actual count of tickets in each status, not activity for the day.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Dashboard
1. Start the server (if not running):
   ```powershell
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/web/dash.html
   ```

### Manual Data Collection
The script automatically runs at 11:30 PM, but you can run it manually:

```powershell
# Run now (will only fetch if not already run today)
node execView.js

# Force refresh (deletes cache first)
Remove-Item data\execView.json; node execView.js
```

### Test the Scheduled Task
```powershell
# Run the task right now (doesn't wait for 11:30 PM)
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'Zendesk-ExecView-Daily'

# Check if it completed successfully (0 = success)
(Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName 'Zendesk-ExecView-Daily').LastTaskResult
```

## 📈 What to Expect

### Over the Next 10 Days
As the system collects data each night at 11:30 PM, you'll build up:
- **Day 1-10**: Dashboard will show growing trend lines
- **Day 10+**: Dashboard will show the most recent 10 weekdays (rolling window)

### Data Accuracy
- **Ticket counts**: These are **point-in-time snapshots** showing "how many tickets are in this status right now"
- **NOT** activity counts (e.g., "tickets opened today")
- This gives you an accurate view of workload and backlog trends

### Example Interpretation
If you see:
- **Open tickets: 145 → 160 → 175** over 3 days
  - Your backlog is growing (tickets arriving faster than being solved)
- **Open tickets: 145 → 130 → 120** over 3 days
  - Your team is catching up (solving faster than new arrivals)
