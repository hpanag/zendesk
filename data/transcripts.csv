Subject: PO VHNJ85 - HCA CHIPPENHAM MEDICAL CENTER - missing parts 
 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Hello, 
 &nbsp; 
 I sent an email on 04/22/25 about missing parts for the PO above. 
 &nbsp; 
 The customer is still having issues with the parts. 
 &nbsp; 
 Here is what the customer is emailed this afternoon: 
 &nbsp; 
 We received the previously requested missing parts, however, Panel C is missing the pilot holes for the cam screw, so we are unable to complete building the desk. How should I proceed in requesting this replacement part with the predrilled
 holes? 
 &nbsp; 
 I don’t have any other information. 
 &nbsp; 
 Is there a way for someone to call her? 
 &nbsp; 
 Her name is Courtney Rodriguez, at 804-483-4059 or email 
Courtney.Rodriguez1@hcahealthcare.com. 
 &nbsp; 
 Her Staples order is 7649665593.

 &nbsp; 
 Can you stop this delivery? 
 &nbsp; 
 The customer could not wait any longer so I processed a new order for her. 
 The customer wanted a new unit. 
 &nbsp; 
 Sorry, I hadn’t heard from anyone so I decided to process that new order, see PO WHMT24.

 Your order is on the way to you.




Important reminders about the delivery of your purchase:  
 
 
Tracking information will be available in about two days. You will receive a shipment confirmation email once it ships.  
Your purchase will arrive in multiple boxes. It is possible they will not arrive all on the same day depending on the carrier.  
If your order is 9 or more boxes, the carrier will contact you by phone to arrange a date and time frame to deliver.  
Because these products are large and heavy, we recommend that 2 people carry the boxes into the home.  
Please note that the carriers provide threshold delivery; the carriers are not permitted to carry parcels into your home, and will therefore leave the boxes outside.  
 

Have any questions about assembly or your order?

247678,Carrier accessorial and extra charges,closed,normal,email,2025-07-10T11:48:19Z,2025-07-14T13:02:50Z,20745978599188,20702390811796,17781453524116,15951975047444,5,"[2025-07-10T11:48:19.000Z] User 20745978599188: Good morning, 
 &nbsp; 
 When carriers ask for approval of extra charges, they need to provide a confirmation of what those costs are or will be.
 
 Depending on the carrier, rate agreements are based on different criteria, which they need to calculate and confirm. The responsibility does not fall on Esolutions to do so.
 
 &nbsp; 
 Understandably, the person contacting us for approval is likely unaware of the specific agreements (various ABF or Estes terminals, for example), and will need to validate with their team internally before asking us for
 approval, or at least, after notifying us of an issue first, as a head’s up. 
 It is part of their responsibility as a carrier, not Esolutions as a customer. 
 &nbsp; 
 As a note, when carriers mention ‘’Customer cannot receive’’, or are unclear about reasons for asking extra charges or upgrading their service level, please don’t hesitate to probe for details.
 
 &nbsp; 
 When extra charges are approved, and by copying
Transport@esolutionsfurniture.com, this makes invoice audit and approval faster and seamless. Isabelle has quick access to pro numbers, reasons, etc and can match invoice charges with approvals. She can
 then escalate to me or Mike if situations need attention. 
 I will let Isabelle decide if she wants to be copied on final replies and approval of extra charges. 
 &nbsp; 
 That being said, some accessorial charges are flat rates, or come up often, like extra flight of stairs with AMJ, or free storage days with ABF. 
 &nbsp; 
 Below are some standard fees from AMJ, as an example. We can create others to simplify and speed up the approvals to get orders delivered quickly. &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
  
 &nbsp; 
 Have a great day ! 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
  
 &nbsp;

 Just a quick note, there is no need to copy the transport email if the conversation with the carriers is through Zendesk.
 
 I have a limited access to Zendesk but it allows me to view the conversation and see approvals. 
 &nbsp; 
 Regards,
 
 &nbsp;

When approval is given, would you like us to forward the e-mail thread to transport with details of the charge if you are already not on the chain?

 &nbsp; 
 There is no need if the conversation is taking place in Zendesk. Otherwise, yes, please send an email to transport.

A company called Bison? The full size bed is priced at $2094 and the queen which is $2500 is shipped by Bestar. It also has better reviews. Are the ones shipped by Bison a lower quality? What’s the backstory? I’d rather pay a little more and get the queen if that’s the case. Also please note I’ve been on hold after trying to call for these answers and it’s been over twenty minutes. I hope that’s not a sign that this company does not care about its customers.

[2025-07-10T11:55:16.000Z] User 20700188817812: Hello
&nbsp;
Thank you for reaching out
&nbsp;
To clarify, Bison and Amazon are authorized vendors of Bestar products and are considered fully authorized retail partners. The products they sell are genuine Bestar items and of the same high quality as those sold directly through our website.
&nbsp;
That said, while the product itself remains the same, the shopping experience, shipping process, and post-sale support may vary depending on the seller. If you prefer direct service and support from Bestar, we recommend purchasing directly from our website at www.bestar.com.
&nbsp;
Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions—we’re here to help.
Warm regards,

 Are they meant to go together? &nbsp;If so, is there a way to connect the two pieces of furniture? &nbsp;Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

[2025-07-10T12:58:50.000Z] User 20700188817812: Hello,&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Yes, both the Contemporary Closet System 26162-17 - Pur 25W 19D and the Pur Queen Murphy Bed 65"" are from the Pur Collection. While they are designed to complement each other stylistically, there is no direct hardware to physically connect the two pieces. However, they can be arranged side by side to create a cohesive and functional space.
&nbsp;
If you need any further assistance or details, please let us know!

Thanks for the pictures and I too see nowhere to use the odd parts that we put in the box, and I'd say those odd parts got put in by accident. The parts order # is 1693834 which should ship from our warehouse in a few business days to ship via Fed Ex Ground.

From my calculations its about 380 dollars to hold. Which could be cheaper then the return fee and fees to then re-ship once available.

  Your order is on the way 
  Your order is on the way to you.




 Important reminders about the delivery of your purchase:
 

  
 
  Tracking information will be available in about two days. You will receive a shipment confirmation email once it ships. 
  Your purchase will arrive in multiple boxes. It is possible they will not arrive all on the same day depending on the carrier. 
  If your order is 9 or more boxes, the carrier will contact you by phone to arrange a date and time frame to deliver. 
  Because these products are large and heavy, we recommend that 2 people carry the boxes into the home. 
  Please note that the carriers provide threshold delivery; the carriers are not permitted to carry parcels into your home, and will therefore leave the boxes outside.

 Hi- 
I will just need to return the new doors that were shipped. They are unused and boxed up. We cut off the excess length on the original doors that were sent as a solution since the doors that were sent were still the incorrect size. Not returning the whole wardrobe, just the recent doors that were sent

&nbsp;
This is still on its way to the hub in Toronto, once received and scanned in. Your tracking number will populate on the NLI website. Due to the size and volume of the desk, this was shipped via a freight carrier which will require a delivery date to be scheduled. NLI will call to set this up, or when tracking populates, you may call the number on their site using your tracking number to schedule.&nbsp;

 Hello Shirley, yes everything is packed I don’t even open it. We just moved to a new place and realized it won’t work. 
Okay fine on the return 20% I understand and will rate the experience according to this unfortunate fee. We didn’t even open it. 

If I have to pay around $200 I expect someone to pick this up from my current address at 197 Irving Avenue, Brooklyn NY 11237.

 ORDER #19778 Your order is on the way  Your order is on the way to you.&nbsp;

Important reminders about the delivery of your purchase:&nbsp;
   Tracking information will be available in about two days. You will receive a shipment confirmation email once it ships.  Your purchase will arrive in multiple boxes. It is possible they will not arrive all on the same day depending on the carrier.  If your order is 9 or more boxes, the carrier will contact you by phone to arrange a date and time frame to deliver.  Because these products are large and heavy, we recommend that 2 people carry the boxes into the home.  Please note that the carriers provide threshold delivery; the carriers are not permitted to carry parcels into your home, and will therefore leave the boxes outside.  
Have any questions about assembly or your order?&nbsp;

 Hi. I would like the 15% refunded since it is on sale now. Please lmk soon as possible. The Amazon customer service must have been a robot because they gave you wrong information concerning my request previously. Now tomorrow is the deadline to return the murphy bed. Thx

How do I know which box to tackle first? It seems daunting to open all at once, then deciding which box to start assembly. 
  Dave&nbsp;

[2025-07-09T11:08:50.000Z] User 20700188817812: Hi, thank you for your message!
&nbsp;
To begin assembling your Bestar Pur 80W bed, you'll want to start with the box labeled 26185-110017, as it contains the assembly guide for the bed. You'll also need the following boxes to complete the bed portion:
  26185-120017  26185-130017  KI-7689 (this is the bed mechanism)  Once the bed is fully assembled, you can move on to the box labeled 26503-110017, which contains the bed storage unit along with its own assembly guide.
&nbsp;

However, I will make an inquiry to determine whether these can be provided, as doing so may help reduce the frequency of such fee-related requests. In this particular instance, we will require the fee to be supplied, as our customer accounts—who will ultimately be responsible for these payments—must review and approve the associated fees.&nbsp;

 Stacey

[2025-07-09T11:40:21.000Z] User 20700188817812: Hi,
&nbsp;
Thanks for your question!
&nbsp;
The main difference between the Nebula and Claremont queen Murphy beds is the design. Both models use the same materials, the same bed mechanism, and accommodate the same mattress size.
&nbsp;
Queen size Murphy beds accommodate most standard Queen mattresses (8–12 inches thick, 60–90 lb, 60"" x 80"") to let you choose the most comfortable option. Mattress not included. Do not use with a box spring.
&nbsp;
Both beds feature a dual piston system that allows you to fold the space-saving bed up and down smoothly and quickly.
&nbsp;
Best regards,

Important reminders about the delivery of your purchase:    Tracking information will be available in about two days. You will receive a shipment confirmation email once it ships.  Your purchase will arrive in multiple boxes. It is possible they will not arrive all on the same day depending on the carrier.  If your order is 9 or more boxes, the carrier will contact you by phone to arrange a date and time frame to deliver.  Because these products are large and heavy, we recommend that 2 people carry the boxes into the home.  Please note that the carriers provide threshold delivery; the carriers are not permitted to carry parcels into your home, and will therefore leave the boxes outside.   
Have any questions about assembly or your order?

(4:02:22 p.m.) Dylan Pfeiff: Actually have a bit of a strange question for you, is there anyway to purchase replacement panels for some of your desks? I ordered one on the credenza desks in the hansen cherry, and was looking into the desk return but it will be too big for my space. Was most likely going to cut it down, as I only need like a 24x20 surface area more

(4:03:04 p.m.) Dylan Pfeiff: so was wondering if possible to order panels and create the return I am looking for this way, just want it to match what I have

(4:05:12 p.m.) Sam: Let me forward this to a parts rep to better advise, unfortunately I dont believe in this case we can sell panels to modify the units as it is a safety issue. Please await their reply.

(4:11:24 p.m.) David S.: Hello

(4:11:29 p.m.) David S.: Sorry for the wait

[2025-07-08T20:06:57.000Z] User 20700138351892: Hi Caller +1 (505) 420-9501 ,
&nbsp;
Thank you for your email. I am sorry to learn of the (damage/missing parts) to your unit.
&nbsp;
To have a replacement part order placed for you, please provide the following information:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; Full name on the order
  The full original address to which the order shipped—And the address you’d like the part(s) sent to if they differ  The number beginning with A1 or A2 listed on the front cover of the assembly booklet  The stamped-on lot code located on either the front or the back of the assembly booklet—typically in blue or black ink  A phone number we can add to the order should we have any questions  The letter associated with the damaged/missing part(s) that can be found in the instruction booklet on the page with the exploded view--or if it still has the sticker--the full part number beginning with a W or S for a wood piece or an H for a piece of hardware.  The Bush Industries Model #--this is typically printed on the cardboard box in which you received the unit.  &nbsp;
I will reply with a parts order reference number and an estimated time that the order should ship out.
&nbsp;
Thank you,
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

[2025-07-08T14:04:25.000Z] User 20702390811796: Good morning, Gina,&nbsp;
&nbsp;
As this order was shipped through a 3rd party carrier, you will need to contact your point of purchase to place a new order for the top. Bush does not own the rights to shipping and will be unable to take responsibility for the lost piece. Our records indicate that this was purchased through Bison Office. Please let us know if you need any assistance with contacting your point of purchase.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Have a great day.&nbsp;

 Hi! I ordered this murphy bed a few days ago and see now that it is on sale. Is it possible to price match to the current sale of 15% off instead of cancelling/reordering? It would save me an extra $50 and that would be a huge help to me. Thank you!!

&nbsp;
Tracking Update for Order 2004892184
&nbsp;
Fast-Frate has just scanned this order under tracking number 2004892184. Since it was shipped on the 3rd, the tracking information had not yet fully updated. Now that it’s been scanned, we should see a more accurate ETA populate soon.
&nbsp;
I recommend allowing until the end of the week for the system to reflect the updated delivery estimate. Fast-Frate should also be reaching out to schedule delivery either later this week or early next.
&nbsp;

 We received the HAT6030ABW top for replacement order number S200796331 and unfortunately it has scratches on the top similar to the one on the original order.&nbsp; I am including pictures of the top and pictures
 of the box so you will be able to see the box is in pretty good condition.&nbsp; As you can see there are no gouges that penetrate the cardboard and the top is surrounded in a layer of styrofoam &nbsp;so the only thing I can think is the tops were scratched before they
 were packaged or they are somehow getting scratching during the packing process.&nbsp; The black walnut finish is very dark so unfortunately it shows everything.&nbsp; We tried to touch up the original top with a walnut furniture marker and blend it in but the scratches
 are still noticeable because they go against the grain.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your help and please let me know if you need any additional information.

 Hello Bush,



Please provide an update regarding PO&nbsp;WEYC45. FedEx tracking&nbsp;463915258666 shows it was delivered to a location in Texas. Tracking number 464175726723 appears to be for shipping this from where it landed to the customer, but this tracking number hasn't moved
 in over a week.



The customer advised that this is not the first time ordering this item has resulted in delays like this, so anything that can be done to get an item delivered to the ASAP would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;



Thank you for choosing Staples. Please let us know if you require further assistance.



Regards,&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The mattress is 12” thick. If so, which model is best?

[2025-07-08T20:14:28.000Z] User 20700188817812: Hello,
&nbsp;
Thank you for your inquiry.
&nbsp;
Yes, a Loom &amp; Leaf Relaxed Firm queen mattress with a thickness of 12 inches can fit in our Bestar Murphy beds, provided it meets the following criteria:
  Queen size: 60” x 80”  Thickness: 8–12 inches  Weight: 60–90 lbs  No futons or box springs  Murphy beds are designed to accommodate most standard Queen mattresses to let you choose the most comfortable option (mattress not included).
&nbsp;
For reference, our Murphy beds also accommodate most standard Full mattresses with the following requirements:
  Full size: 54” x 75”  Thickness: 8–10 inches  Weight: 60–90 lbs  No futons or box springs  Please let us know if you’d like help selecting the best model for your mattress and space. We’re happy to assist!

[2025-07-10T00:31:31.000Z] User 39103248759956: It looks like the mattress weighs 93 lbs. Would it still work?

[2025-07-10T12:00:10.000Z] User 20700188817812: Hello,&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thank you for your question.
&nbsp;
The recommended mattress weight for the Murphy bed is 60–90 lbs to ensure proper function and safety. A mattress weighing 93 lbs is slightly above this range, and while it may still work, it could potentially affect the bed’s operation or long-term durability.
&nbsp;
Feel free to reach out with any further questions.
Best regards,

    You all were recently such a big help to me recently, I thought I'd
    reach out again.

    My wife and I noticed....and it doesn't take much effort to
    see.....that the new desk I purchased has LOT of areas like this on
    the edges....where a small amount of the particle board shows
    through.

    Do you have any type of ""touch up"" product (that would closely match
    this off-white color) you can send us to help mask this out?

    

    Please advise.

         Hello Thom -&nbsp;

          &nbsp;

          I am so glad to hear that my last-minute suggestion to swap
          the panels and slides worked like a charm and I thought it
          might! Like I said I was an assemble for Bush for many years
          which helped me help you today! Fyi - I did send the ticket on
          your very kind words to my supervisor for her review and I'm
          sure a big fat raise is on the way! LOL Your Parts Order #
          S200797176 has been canceled!

          &nbsp;

          You are welcome!

          &nbsp;

          Have a great week!&nbsp;

             Hi Tracy.... You were RIGHT! 😊 See the
              attached photo.&nbsp; 
             As you visualized and suggested, I switched
              and flipped panels around, and relocated the sliders to
              different positions.... and all is correct now!&nbsp; Thank you
              so much, and please forward my email onto your
              supervisor(s) for me so he/she/they know what a great job
              you did in solving this issue for me. As I mentioned
              previously, you were able to visualize an outcome that I
              just didn't see and didn't think would work. You saved
              your company money by not having to reship parts that were
              actually fine to begin
                with. Also saved me time in being able to continue
                getting this desk assembled without further delays.
                Thank you for the great customer support!

&nbsp;
Rest assured, we are doing our best to ensure that your package arrives in perfect condition. We have also added a note to your order with your gate code #2234 and instructions for the driver to press ""#"" before entering the numbers.

Additionally, we have requested that the delivery company call you upon arrival to make sure you're available to receive the package. Since you’re on the first floor with easy access, that should help make the delivery go smoothly.

[2025-07-07T18:09:21.000Z] User 20700130113300: Jill called and said she was missing hdwe and instructions for the hutch. I let her know that it comes in two boxes. &nbsp;She will look around the school and let me know if she found it or if she needs it re-shipped. &nbsp;She also received a unit in the wrong color. &nbsp;She will also send pictures of the model number for ORS to RPL

[2025-07-07T18:10:56.000Z] User 20700130113300: Hello Jill,
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is a PDF copy of the instructions for the hutch. Please let me know if you didn't receive the box with model
number WC24477C1 and we can reship that for you. &nbsp;Regarding the incorrect color unit, please provide a picture of the
model number printed on that box or if the box has been opened, a picture of the incorrect color unit.
&nbsp;
Thank you and have a wonderful day!

  Thank you so much for the instructions!&nbsp; We checked and do not find the second box to the hutch.&nbsp; We have a box with item # WC81210C1, color platinum grey.&nbsp; I will email a photo shortly from my phone.&nbsp; If you could ship the remaining box to the hutch to get that started so we can finish our desk assemble we would greatly appreciate it!&nbsp; Then, if you can provide an RA and shipping label we would be happy to send this box back.&nbsp; I will note that two drawers were assembled and will have to be disassembled due to the fact that this was the first box our maintenance guy started on before we caught that it was the wrong color/incorrect item.&nbsp; Our apologies.

  As noted in the previous email, the incorrect item was opened and two drawers were assembled.&nbsp; This was the first box our maintenance director started with so he did not realize it was the wrong color until a little way into the project.&nbsp; We can dis-assemble the drawers for shipment.  
  I appreciate your prompt help with the replacement of the correct item.

 I just asked our shipping department, and the order can't be brought back to be held as it's already loaded onto the trailer for shipping.&nbsp;

 Hello - 
 I'm wondering how long your sale goes for? 
 In addition, if I am interested in a product which is out of stock (ash grey), can I order it during the sale for delivery when it's available? 
 If I decide to go with the white one which is in stock, can I request delivery at a later date? 
 Thank you, Alison

 Many thanks for your response.&nbsp; Yes, we would like to delay the release date of August 26th if that is possible?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, can I assume we will receive the Murphy bed by September 3rd
 through 5th?&nbsp; By the way, if this is too far out, we’ll take delivery sooner? 
 &nbsp; 
 Do you know if it’s possible to receive a swatch of the wood finish?&nbsp; - I can also check their website if you prefer? 
 &nbsp; 
 I look forward to hearing back from you!

Your order is currently set to be released on August 26th. We’ll do our best to ensure delivery between September 3rd and 5th, depending on the carrier’s schedule and transit time. If an earlier delivery becomes possible, we’ll be happy to accommodate.
&nbsp;
And yes, we can absolutely send you a swatch of the wood finish. Could you please confirm which color(s) you’re interested in, as well as the best mailing address to send them to? We’ll get that arranged for you right away.
&nbsp;
Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions—we’re happy to help!

 I’m very excited to receive my new desk and appreciate the smooth ordering process so far. However, I noticed that I did not receive the 10% discount for signing up for your email list, as the welcome email and discount code (WELCOME) arrived after I had already completed my purchase. 
 Would it be possible to apply the 10% discount retroactively to my order? 
 Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you.

&nbsp;
This shipped out and arrived at NLI on the 19th of June.
I spoke with NLI and they said it has been sitting on the dock.
I reached out to Metro to Home, they gave me Koch Wilson LTD. Dispatcher.
I sent them the BOL and asked them to please get this picked up.
They have it on the board to pick up today before 4pm.
We were not made aware that WE had to contact Koch Wilson. Usually when it is dropped off at a middleman, they contact the supply chain and let them know it is there.
In any case, Moving forward there will not be an issue.

 Hi there,&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Thank you for reaching out to us. The part would not have had the connectors attached as it was only the part that was ordered. I have placed another parts order for the connectors for this unit. Please allow 1-3 business days for this to ship out from our
 warehouse via FedEx ground.&nbsp;

Thank you,&nbsp;

&nbsp;
I am sorry to hear that you are having issues with the zippers on your cushions. The warranty for the units you purchased are 1 year. The purchase was made in November of 2023. We unfortunately no longer have the cushions in stock and the unit has been discontinued so we do not have the ability to provide parts for this unit any longer. I would advise reaching out to an upholster to see if the zippers may need to be replaced.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thank you,&nbsp;

Hi Kellie, 
  Just wanted to let you know that I have still not received the order and have been having a poor experience with FedEx. As it appears you had paid for express shipping, FedEx has done a poor job actually delivering the product to my address and has changed the delivery to standard delivery. I have been on the call with FedEx over the past week on 4 different occasions and just got off the phone after another failed delivery attempt telling them that I will just pick up the order from their facility. They keep giving me poor reasons on why the order can't be delivered but I'm guessing the size of the package is deterring their drivers from actually dropping off this order at my place. I realize that there is likely nothing in your capacity to rectify this issue but wanted to keep you in the loop of the&nbsp;situation and the poor service I have gotten from the chosen delivery provider.  
  Thanks

I'm very sorry to hear that the carrier has not been able to deliver your box order. &nbsp;I will reach out to FedEx and get back to you. If we can't resolve this within a reasonable timeframe, I will send out another box with an alternate carrier.&nbsp;

 &nbsp; 
 The 649 Munitions Squadron is renovating one of our buildings and we need new furniture. I have attached the types and quantities of each piece needed broken down by room. The dimensions of the furniture are also included, and I would like to be within a few inches as that was what was measured out to fit! We would like to make this purchase soon as our construction is slated to be finished at the end of August! I have attached the exemption certificate as well. 
 &nbsp; 
 Thank you for all the help!

Details: When we received the box, it was in our front office area just laying on our steps and the box was wet, inside the box was wet, pieces were wet, and a couple of pieces were damaged, and one was already warped. Did not pull everything out thinking we would have to return, and it is big and heavy and if everything inside was wet then other pieces are probably damaged as well if not going to warp since it was wet inside the whole box. The driver did not come in and let us know he was delivering and just left it laying on the steps, so other pieces are probably broken.
  
  
Visual damage to the box and packaging: Absolutely YES.

 Hello Shirley, 
 I sent the pictures on June 23, at this point the customer is beyond frustrated. 
 When the customer received the box it was just laying on their front steps and the box was wet, the inside of the box was also wet. The driver did not come in and let them know it was there, just leaving it on the steps. The damage to the box is visible but as the driver never delivered it to the customer they were not able to refuse. 
 The box number for the damaged box is 8295482022750000R. 
 Item # 167072-435RRDB (Not sure box labels not clear) CAD: 410063/PRCL0682  DIMS: 71 X 20 X 5 in

Quantity: 1 of 3 
 The last e-mail has ticket #  244829, parts request routed to experts. Why was this not done on June 23 when I emailed the pictures. 
 Please send out a replacement for this box ASAP, if you are not able to do this they a RA is needed for the complete desk and we will order a new one. 
 Thank you, I look forward to your prompt response.

&nbsp;I am sorry for any inconvenience with the unit moving. It is most likely due to the sliders. When closed they grip a rubber stopper to keep it closed. This can cause a too tight of grip in some cases. This will lessen over time. You could use the furniture coasters to keep the unit in place. 2 of them in the front should do the trick. &nbsp;

 Good morning,&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Stock is available, however, a new PO will be needed as the PODs are signed for free and clear. Bush will not be responsible for replacing at no cost for this reason.&nbsp;

 Good afternoon ~~ 
 &nbsp; 
 Thank you for your email.&nbsp; My first name is Tate … my last name is Henry … please feel free to call me by my first name, Tate. 
 &nbsp; 
 Numerous staff have assisted me with opening all the drawers &amp; looking behind &amp; under them, as well as sometimes they are taped to the bottom of the unit but nothing there either.&nbsp; None of
 the items requested (the packing slip, 2 handles, 4 wheels, or 2 keys) were found anywhere on the unit.&nbsp;
 
 &nbsp; 
 Also, I will be ordering more of these files cabinets in the near future … hoping they will all have these items included with them. 
 &nbsp; 
 Thank you for notifying the vendor. 
 &nbsp; 
 Sincerely, 
 &nbsp; 
 Tate

 Good afternoon Henry,&nbsp;



I'm truly sorry for the condition of your item(s).



In order to get this part replaced for you, I have been asked to contact you and verify that you have opened the bottom

drawer all the way and even looked behind the drawer to make certain you do not have the parts.&nbsp; In short, the missing items

are generally packed in the bottom drawer and can fall behind it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once confirmed I can request a replacement of the

missing parts.&nbsp;



• Part number/Part name that is damaged/missing

&nbsp; &nbsp;roller wheels-How many are needed?&nbsp; (Four (4)

&nbsp; &nbsp;drawer handles- quantity of two needed (Two (2)

&nbsp; &nbsp;two keys-serial number M275



Once we have this information, we will take care of this for you.



Thank you for contacting Staples. &nbsp;Please let us know if you need further assistance.



Best Regards,



Customer Service Expert

 Hi Jo Dee, 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Ken Smogor with Office360 in Indianapolis.&nbsp; I hope all is well.&nbsp; I have a customer that looks to have some of your Series A Furniture.&nbsp; If this is not correct please let me know.&nbsp; Below is a small
 list of products that the customer is looking for.&nbsp; I hope you can help me with some solution.&nbsp;
 
 &nbsp; 
 
 Img 4466&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer is needing two new lock core kits with keys.&nbsp; The two she has are in silver and all the other hutch cores are in black.&nbsp;
  
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 
 Customer has two corner units that she put together.&nbsp; She would like to replace one of the corner units with a rectangle work surface.&nbsp; Something around
 60” wide?&nbsp; I know the depth is 27”.&nbsp; She will use the piece to hold performance and job reviews with employees.&nbsp;
  
 &nbsp; 
 
 Do you have adjustable keyboard arms with mouse pad attached?&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, she uses a keyboard tray but wants something more adjustable.&nbsp; It will be
 placed under her corner work surface.&nbsp;   
 &nbsp; 
 Here is all of my contact information.&nbsp; Please feel free to give me a call if you have any additional questions 
 &nbsp; 
 Have a great day, 
 &nbsp; 
 Ken

&nbsp;
Thank you for reaching out to us regarding this. The lock assemblies for the Series A are only available in the silver, if she would like to replace her black ones with the silver, I am happy to ensure she is provided a quote for those, I would just need the following information:&nbsp;
  Name and Phone number for the order   Shipping address   Model number of the unit  Revision number (number beginning with A1 or A2 on the assembly guide) if they have it  Lot Code (stamped 8-digit number on the title page of the assembly guide) if they have it  &nbsp;
As for the replacement of the corner units with a 60W, this unit should work perfectly. Series A 60W Desk | BBF. The depth is 26.81"", the length is 59.57.""
&nbsp;
We have this for an adjustable keyboard tray. Articulating Keyboard Tray | BBF. This does not have a mouse pad attached unfortunately but is extremely adjustable.
&nbsp;
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thank you,&nbsp;

Have a delightful day!

 Hi Jodee, 
 Hope you can help with this. We just installed this PO. The top drawer on this pedestal seems to be defective. It will not open. Attached images and a video.
 
 Do you know what we would need to resolve this? Do you send out a replacement pedestal to swap out?

 Here are 3 pictures and a video. The large bottom drawer is sitting crooked but can open, not sure if that would be throwing the top drawer off. There were screws left in the bottom drawer also.

 Hello, 
 &nbsp; 
 The right extender top drawer will not open. The men who came to build the desk told the owner of the desk that they were aware of this issue and that they would be putting in a notice of this but still wanted
 us to reach out.  
 Will this desk need fully replaced again or will someone be able to come to repair it? The owner of the desk hasn’t been able to move into her office due to not having a desk. If someone will be repairing
 it she can start moving in, if it needs fully replaced she will have to wait to move till its replaced. 
 &nbsp; 
 Thanks!

[2025-07-04T21:03:32.000Z] User 26806117506452: Hi there,&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thank you so much for reaching out to us. This is an extremely peculiar situation. For the bottom drawer, I would advise adjusting the alignment according to this video https://youtu.be/UGRzQa0FMh0. For the top drawer, I would advise pulling it out with any means necessary and if anything breaks, please let us know and we will replace it. From the description and the video, I suspect it may just be faulty drawer slides. Please provide the following information:
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
  The number beginning with A1 or A2 listed on the front cover of the assembly booklet  The stamped-on lot code located on either the front or the back of the assembly booklet—typically in blue or black ink  A phone number we can add to the order should we have any questions  The letter associated with the damaged/missing part(s) that can be found in the instruction booklet on the page with the exploded view--or if it still has the sticker--the full part number beginning with a W or S for a wood piece or an H for a piece of hardware. (if any addition parts are damaged)  &nbsp;
I will reply with a parts order reference number and an estimated time that the order should ship out.
&nbsp;
Thank you,
&nbsp;
Have a delightful day!

Good afternoon, 
 
&nbsp; 
 
We had another motor box go out on us. I was able to lower it all the way, but it never went back up when it was lowered all the way and won’t raise back up. Would I be able to request another motor to replace this one?
 
 
&nbsp; 
 
Thank you.

For your reference, order BHUS8940 was originally refunded to the customer's original method of payment on May 6, 2025, in the amount of $1,693.34.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
We would like to inform you that payment recovery has now been successfully completed for order BHUS8940, under reference BHUS9511, for the same amount of $1,693.34.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Could you please confirm whether a credit memo is still required?
&nbsp;
Have a great day

 Our PO 0283307111 arrived with a damaged piece.&nbsp; It did not appear damaged from outside the box but it has damage to the corner of the desk.&nbsp; Can we get a new top sent out? Would you want the piece returned to you?&nbsp;

 Good Afternoon, 
 &nbsp; 
 I hope this email finds you well. 
 &nbsp; 
 This is to inform you that the end user has received the items in damaged condition. Please refer to the email below and initiate the return process at your
 earliest convenience. Attached are pictures of the damaged items for your reference. 
 &nbsp; 
 Can you respond to your emails from the company and let them know one of the desks came damaged? The box had no damage, just the desk, so it was not shipping related damages. We would like them to send a replacement
 and need direction on how to return the damaged desk. Photo of the damage is attached. Thank you! 
 &nbsp; 
 Looking forward to your response.

  Name on the order  The original address to which the order shipped—And the address you’d like the part(s) sent to if they differ  The number beginning with A1 or A2 listed on the front cover of the assembly booklet  The stamped-on lot code located on either the front or the back of the assembly booklet—typically in blue or black ink  A phone number we can add to the order should we have any questions  The letter associated with the damaged/missing part(s) that can be found in the instruction booklet on the page with the exploded view--or if it still has the sticker--the full part number beginning with a W or S for a wood piece or an H for a piece of hardware.  The Bush Industries Model #--this is typically printed on the cardboard box in which you received the unit.  &nbsp;
I will reply with a parts order reference number and an estimated time that the order should ship out.
&nbsp;
Thank you,
&nbsp;
Have a delightful day!

Thank you for providing this information. I have not located your order specifically. I would recommend reaching out to Lowes to get that box that you are missing. It is likely the KI-7652. If you could get the PO number for your order through them, I can look more thoroughly.&nbsp;

I am really&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;in the quality of the products as I paid a decent amount of money for them.&nbsp;  
  Is there any way I could reorder extra shelves to replace the ones that are becoming&nbsp;warped? For reference, the Instruction Sheet # is A184719E and the lot code is 11446274. I can send photos&nbsp;if they are needed.&nbsp;  
  Thank you for your help,&nbsp;

[2025-07-04T17:22:59.000Z] User 26806117506452: Hi there,&nbsp;
&nbsp;
I am sorry to hear that those shelves are sagging. I would be happy to replace those shelves for you covered under warranty as long as the weight on them did not exceed 50lbs. Please provide the part number and the quantity of shelves you are requesting as well as a shipping address.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thank you,&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Have a delightful day!

[2025-07-07T17:55:51.000Z] User 33455316050196: Hi Brianna!  
  Thank you so much for getting back to me and thank you for being willing to replace the shelves for me. I just verified and the weight on them did not exceed 50 pounds. I am looking in the manual right now - the Instruction Sheet # is A184719E and the lot code is 11446274. It looks like the moveable shelves are board H. I would need 6 of them to replace the ones in the two bookshelves I have now, if that makes sense. Let me know&nbsp;if you need better information from me!  
  The shipping address is:  
  Josh Hanson  Our Lady of Consolation Church  4865 11 Mile Road NE  Rockford, MI 49341

&nbsp;
Thank you for your email. I am sorry to learn of the missing parts to your unit.
&nbsp;
To have a replacement part order placed for you, please provide the following information:
&nbsp;
  Name on the order  The original address to which the order shipped—And the address you’d like the part(s) sent to if they differ  The number beginning with A1 or A2 listed on the front cover of the assembly booklet  The stamped-on lot code located on either the front or the back of the assembly booklet—typically in blue or black ink  A phone number we can add to the order should we have any questions  The letter associated with the damaged/missing part(s) that can be found in the instruction booklet on the page with the exploded view--or if it still has the sticker--the full part number beginning with a W or S for a wood piece or an H for a piece of hardware.  The Bush Industries Model #--this is typically printed on the cardboard box in which you received the unit.  &nbsp;
I will reply with a parts order reference number and an estimated time that the order should ship out.
&nbsp;
Thank you,
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;I am sorry there is no assembly guide. It is usually located in the box #1. If you look at the blue sticker on each box, there should be a number with a hyphen. Like this
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; 26183-410017 &nbsp;(as an example.) The second number after the hyphen / dash &nbsp;is a ""1"". That box has the hardware and the assembly guide.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;If you cannot find it, please provide the full name on the Costco order. Who the order was sent to. &nbsp;Also, the full address on that order. That way I can look up the sales order and see what was purchased.&nbsp;

  Please let me know if you need anything further.

[2025-07-01T21:39:24.000Z] User 20700145348884: Fabiane Roy , sooo he's going to need a full box 2 of the 26162-2 replaced and every box except the KI box replaced for the Murphy bed. How do you think we should proceed?

[2025-07-01T21:40:25.000Z] User 20700145348884: Hello,
&nbsp;
I do have one additional question. You said that you had the parts missing. The parts for the storage unit are fully box two, and for the Murphy bed, it's all of the boxes except for the bed mechanism box. Do you mind explaining how these boxes are missing?&nbsp;

[2025-07-01T23:49:56.000Z] User 38883629665172: Sure no problem. So based on what I am guessing we are missing a box that has the cabinet to house the bed frame and also in that box are the side pieces for the shelf systems as we have 2 each of the top, bottom, back and shelves. See pictures below.

[2025-07-02T15:13:04.000Z] User 20700188817812: Hello Kayla, &nbsp;here are the prices for&nbsp;
&nbsp;
26162-2217 (799 in stock) 186.99$ + taxes
26183-510017 (218 in stock) 297.99$ + taxes
26183-520017(206 in stock) 363.99$ + taxes
total before taxes: 848.97$

[2025-07-02T17:14:17.000Z] User 20700145348884: Hello,
&nbsp;
What about the doors? He also needs 60 and 61. Since he has the older model, would that need to be issued by Brianna or Mike as a paid parts request?

[2025-07-02T18:13:41.000Z] User 20700188817812: price 26183-530017 &nbsp;(7 in stock) at 653.99$

[2025-07-02T18:46:31.000Z] User 20700145348884: Hello Menard,
&nbsp;
Regarding the boxes for the Murphy bed itself, it would be about 200 dollars cheaper to purchase it from our website at the moment. https://www.bestar.com/product/full-wall-bed-26183/?variation=6 If you would still like to purchase the boxes individually, please let me know and I'll process that quote for you.
&nbsp;
Thank you,

[2025-07-02T18:48:58.000Z] User 38883629665172: What would just the box for the cabinet of the murphy bed cost?&nbsp; As for the Shelves I might be able to outsource these. 
  Thanks

[2025-07-02T21:40:22.000Z] User 20700145348884: Hello,
&nbsp;
It would actually be all three boxes.&nbsp;
26183-510017 297.99$ + taxes
26183-520017 363.99$ + taxes
26183-530017 at 653.99
&nbsp;
Without taxes, it would cost 1,315.97

Hello Sam,

Thank you for your assistance.

Customer called today, to say the first time the item was delivered it had big fork lift holes in the box, with the top of the desk damaged and unusable. &nbsp;The second time box 2 was delivered the delivery agent dropped the box, and customer refused due to damage. 

         

         
&nbsp;

         

         
So she really needs this remaining part of the order box 2 of 2, she provided part numbers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W217340(D)&nbsp; W155014(A), &nbsp; 2 damaged parts. 

         

         
&nbsp;

         

         
We hope this issue can be resolved for our customer.

Good afternoon,            

&nbsp;            

Apologies for the confusion. To send a replacement for Box 2, the unit will need to be opened and all parts inventoried so we can determine the appropriate replacement option.

Nous comptons acheter un lit escamotable de format «&nbsp;Queen&nbsp;» afin de profiter de vos rabais du 1er juillet.

Nous hésitons entre le modèle Nebula et Edge : au-delà de la petite différence de prix et du look du panneau avant et de leur poids, quelles sont les principales différences entre les deux modèles?

Nous tentons de vous joindre par téléphone mais il n’y a aucun service.


Merci pour les précisions :)

[2025-06-30T15:54:24.000Z] User 20702398846868: La seule différence entre les deux modèles est l'esthétique du produit si vous préférez un panneau avant à l'autre pour des raisons de style. N'hésitez pas à me faire savoir si vous avez besoin d'une aide supplémentaire. Passez une excellente journée.

[2025-07-02T12:47:44.000Z] User 38848088660500: Bonjour! 
  Nous avons seulement pris connaissance de votre dernier courriel tard hier soir...  
  Ne sachant pas à quel moment votre vente de la Fête du Canada prenait fin, nous nous sommes empressé de procéder à l'achat d'un lit escamotable queen Nebula entretemps (commande&nbsp;#32769)  
  Ceci dit, ma copine et moi avons toujours des questions importantes à valider. Aujourd'hui, mercredi 2 juillet, c'est plutôt ma copine Laurence qui serait disponible pour recevoir un appel de votre part entre 10h30 et 14h30. Vous pourrez la joindre au 514-212-5407.  
  Nous souhaitons s'entretenir avec vous dès que possible pour maintenir notre achat ou plutôt annuler la commande en cours.  
  
  Merci pour le suivi :)  
  - David Gaudreau et Laurence Sabourin Laflamme  &nbsp;

[2025-07-02T16:55:15.000Z] User 38848088660500: Excellent, je viens tout juste de terminer un bref appel avec ma copine : merci pour l'ensemble du feedback, c'est très apprécié! 
  
  Par ailleurs... j'étais curieux de voir si votre promotion se prolongeait au-delà du 1er juillet et je viens tout juste de repérer une nouvelle offre à -25% sur votre modèle Key West 69L&nbsp;;&nbsp;https://www.bestar.ca/fr/produit/grand-lit-escamotable-69l-kwq169lw-03k/?variation=1387  
  Serait-il possible de changer le commande initiale du Nebula pour le modèle Key West (même format : queen / même couleur : blanc)?  
  S'il est suffisamment tôt dans le processus de commande pour que ce soit possible, avisez-nous simplement et nous validerons cette option en mesurant les dimensions du modèle Key West à notre retour à la maison dès ce soir. Nous confirmerons rapidement par la suite.  
  
  Merci pour tout!  
  - David et Laurence

[2025-07-02T17:56:58.000Z] User 38956792289940: Bonjour Ann, je viens de vérifier les dimensions du modèle Key West 69L et tout fonctionne très bien. Nous souhaitons donc changer si possible notre commande du modèle queen Nebula (queen)&nbsp;pour le modèle Key West 69L (Queen).&nbsp;Pourriez-vous m'indiquer comment procéder au changement? Vu que la commande a été passée hier tard en soirée, j'imagine que cela est possible de le changer&nbsp;?&nbsp;  
  Merci beaucoup et bonne journée!&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Laurence Sabourin&nbsp;

[2025-07-02T18:04:14.000Z] User 38956792289940: Juste également m'assurer avec vous qu'il n'y a pas de coûts associés à ce changement, mais j'imagine que ce n'est pas le cas vu que l'achat ayant été effectué dans moins de 24h et le produit n'a pas été reçu. S'il y a un coût associé au changement, merci de m'en faire part avant d'effectuer le changement et l'annulation du Nebula pour le Key West, nous aviserons en temps et lieu si nous effectuons alors le changement dans notre commande.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Merci beaucoup!&nbsp;

[2025-07-02T18:32:41.000Z] User 20700188817812: Bonjour Laurence,
&nbsp;
Votre commande a été expédiée aujourd’hui.

 The box number is the image name and the part number for each damage within a box was included in the images. The only one without a part number is the lateral file because
 it was fully assembled so the whole file would need to be replaced.

Thank you very much—we have received the parts but once we started to replace these we realized that we actually need all 3 of the Part 60 replacement panels as well as the top panel part 61.&nbsp; Are you able to send me one more Part 60 and Part 61?&nbsp; I'm sorry,
 I didn't realize that all would need to be replaced but the screws have all pulled out so there is no way to fasten them back in place.

 Hi there,  
 
 &nbsp; 
 
 
 No, no one was hurt thankfully. I think the legs just were not under properly when the bed was layed on and they collapsed and cause the pistons to overextend and the panels were damaged as well.&nbsp;

 I’ve attached some photos for you.&nbsp;

 Hi there, 
 &nbsp; 
 We have a murphy bed model 40184-1 where the pistons got over extended and the panels were damaged as the bed went to the floor. 
 &nbsp; 
 I am looking for a quote for: 
 &nbsp; 
 2 replacement pistons—Part KI-985-J 
 2 replacement panels for the front of the cabinet—Part 60
 
 &nbsp; 
 The above would need to be shipped to Regina, Sk, Canada.

 I look forward to hearing from someone.

 Hello Nicole, 
 &nbsp; 
 What I received in the mail weren’t color swatches…they looked like markers, one black, one brown. &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 Could you possibly check on this? 
 

Thanks,

Thank you for your assistance. 

       

       
&nbsp;

       

       
Customer called today, to say the first time the item was delivered it had big fork lift holes in the box, with the top of the desk damaged and unusable. &nbsp;The second time box 2 was delivered the delivery agent dropped the box, and customer refused due to damage. 

       

       
&nbsp;

       

       
So she really needs this remaining part of the order box 2 of 2, she provided part numbers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W217340(D)&nbsp; W155014(A), &nbsp; 2 damaged parts. 

       

       
&nbsp;

       

       
We hope this issue can be resolved for our customer.

Good afternoon,          

&nbsp;          

Apologies for the confusion. To send a replacement for Box 2, the unit will need to be opened and all parts inventoried so we can determine the appropriate replacement option.          

&nbsp;          

Thank you,

The customers initial email said and the driver dropped box # 2, three times taking the box off the truck.

                     

                     
&nbsp;

                     

                     
They also provided a picture of what was damaged, see attached.

                     

                     
&nbsp;

                     

                     
Can you ship the damaged box or let us know what else is needed?

I sincerely apologize for the delay and inconvenience surrounding this order. I have placed Bush’s replacement order #S200780387 ­­­, which consists of item #WC65570C1-03. This replacement will ship via FEDG, taking approximately 3-7 business days. Please allow a couple of days for tracking to populate.                                                  

&nbsp;                                                  

Thank you, have a great day!&nbsp;

Hello Sam,

I&nbsp;am so sorry for the inconvenience we are not able to get photos. Its an entire box number. As per the FedEx tracking 461582950153 the box was refused and return to sender by FedEx.

                                                       

                                                       
&nbsp;

                                                       

                                                       
I&nbsp;contacted the customer to see what box has been received.

Again, I am so sorry for the confusion.

Merci pour votre message.
&nbsp;
Concernant votre demande pour le modèle Grand lit escamotable avec tablettes et armoire avec bureau rétractable (126L) – Orion, 116876-000047, veuillez noter que ce modèle n’est pas offert avec 3 tiroirs intégrés en bas à droite.
&nbsp;
Cependant, il est possible d’ajouter des tiroirs à la grande étagère de 30 po de largeur en y ajoutant l’ensemble de 2 tiroirs pour étagère 30L – Orion (116161-000047).
Vous pouvez consulter ce produit ici :

Donc vous devriez avoir mes infos dans votre système. Est-ce que Marco est toujours dans la compagnie&nbsp;?  1430 Mine Hill Lane, Kelowna, BC V1P 1T6  &nbsp;  Pour ce qui est du meuble de droite auxquels je me réfère, nous avons présentement ce modèle ci-dessous et je me réfère à ces étagères-tiroirs que nous avons présentement et qui vont bien. Marco m’avais dit que l’on peut mix et match des ensembles. Donc en l’occurrence, s’il est possible de prendre cet élément d’étagères-tiroirs dans les même couleurs, ce serait parfait. Merci de confirmer.   Queen Murphy Bed and 2 Shelving Units with Drawers (115W) 26884-47 C’est donc celui-ci que l’on veut remplacer par un côté bureau et l’autre côté étagères-tiroirs.  Merci de m’éclairé sur ces options et au plaisir d’avoir de vos nouvelles  &nbsp;  Cordialement,  &nbsp;   Patrick Rhein  +1 778 760 0595  +1 416 919 8466 Cell.   &nbsp;

[2025-06-26T12:26:23.000Z] User 20700188817812: Bonjour,
&nbsp;
Merci pour votre message et votre fidélité au fil des années.
&nbsp;
Grâce aux informations d’expédition que vous avez fournies, j’ai pu retrouver la commande n° 29038, passée avec Marco le 30 août 2024. Pour votre information, Marco ne fait plus partie de l’entreprise, mais nous disposons de tout votre historique et serons heureux de vous assister avec la même attention.
&nbsp;
Par ailleurs, je vois qu’en août 2024 vous aviez également choisi les produits suivants :
  Système de rangement contemporain avec tiroirs, 25 L x 19 P (réf. 26950-000017)
➤ Voir le produit  Grand lit escamotable avec armoire et bureau rétractable, 97 L (réf. 116875-000017)
➤ Voir le produit  Étagère de chambre étroite, 20 L (réf. 116162-000017)
➤ Voir le produit  Organisateur de garde-robe en coin, 33 L (réf. 26165-17)
➤ Voir le produit  Sofa pour lit double escamotable (sans dossier) (réf. AC-1069-25)
➤ Voir le produit  Aussi, pour clarifier votre demande : l’étagère-tiroirs que vous mentionnez dans le modèle 26884-47 est le Système de rangement contemporain avec tiroirs, 25 L x 19 P (réf. 26871-47)
➤ Voir le produit
&nbsp;
Si je comprends bien, votre préférence serait de changer pour les coloris Gris écorce et Graphite ?
&nbsp;
En attente d’une réponse de votre part.
&nbsp;
N’hésitez pas si vous avez d’autres questions ou besoin d’assistance supplémentaire.

Au plaisir de vous lire bientôt.

[2025-06-26T18:50:50.000Z] User 27539594958484: Chère Ann,  &nbsp;  Désolé pour la confusion  &nbsp;  En décembre 2018 ou Janvier 2019 j’ai acheté cet ensemble Queen Murphy Bed and 2 Shelving Units with Drawers (115W) 26884-47 à travers Costco pour 1430 Mine Hill Lane à Kelowna  En Septembre 2024, j’ai acheté l’ensemble que vous avez mentionnez pour une autre adresse, Devonshire av.  &nbsp;  Aujourd’hui nous devons remplacer le premier mentionné plus haut suite à un incident et après plus de réflexion j’aimerais le remplacer par  &nbsp;  Queen Murphy Bed with Storage Cabinet and Fold-Out Desk (97W) 116875-000017 - Orion en rajoutant 20W Narrow Storage Cabinet with Doors, Drawers and Pull-Out Shelf 116165-000017 - Orion en blanc.   &nbsp;  Ma question est de savoir si l’on peut les mettre soit à droite soit à gauche du lit ou s’il faut choisir avant&nbsp;?   &nbsp;  Aussi pourrais-je avoir les mesures exactes&nbsp;? J’ai 9 pieds 7&nbsp;inch (ou115 inch) max. et je n’ai pas l’impression que ça fit d’après mes calculs. Le mieux est que vous me téléphoniez pour clarifier. Est-ce possible&nbsp;? sur mon portable de préférence.  &nbsp;  Dans tous les cas, donnez-moi le prix avec le narrow storrage et sans.   &nbsp;  Merci et à bientôt  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Patrick Rhein  +1 778 760 0595  +1 416 919 8466 Cell.   &nbsp;

[2025-06-26T19:02:53.000Z] User 20700188817812: Bonjour
&nbsp;
Merci pour votre message et les précisions apportées.
&nbsp;
Concernant votre nouveau projet de remplacement, le modèle Queen Murphy Bed with Storage Cabinet and Fold-Out Desk (97W) – 116875-000017 en collection Orion, ainsi que l’ajout de l’unité 20W Narrow Storage Cabinet with Doors, Drawers and Pull-Out Shelf – 116165-000017 est une excellente combinaison.
&nbsp;
Configuration :
Oui, les unités peuvent être installées à gauche ou à droite, comme le lit est une unité et le Storage Cabinet with Doors, Drawers and Pull-Out Shelf une unité complètement distincte.
&nbsp;
Dimensions totales :
Lit escamotable avec bureau intégré : 97 po de large
&nbsp;
Armoire étroite : 20 po de large
&nbsp;
Total combiné : 117 po, ce qui dépasse légèrement votre espace disponible de 115 po. Il ne sera donc pas possible d’installer les deux modules côte à côte dans cet espace sans modification.
&nbsp;
Options :
Avec l’armoire étroite : 117 po (trop large)
&nbsp;
Sans l’armoire étroite : 97 po (convient parfaitement)
&nbsp;
Pour vous conseiller au mieux, je peux vous appeler afin de discuter de votre configuration.
&nbsp;
Si vous avez un moment de disponibilité, merci de nous le faire savoir, ou vous pouvez également nous joindre directement.
&nbsp;
cordialement,

[2025-06-27T14:03:44.000Z] User 20700188817812: Bonjour Patrick
&nbsp;
Le modèle 116165-000017 est effectivement le meuble de rangement le plus étroit que nous proposons dans cette catégorie.
&nbsp;
Pour additionner les largeurs, il faut d’abord convertir les unités pour qu’elles soient les mêmes.
  19,5 pouces (modèle 116165-000017)  96,1 pouces (modèle 116875-000017)  Total combiné = 19,5 po + 96,1 po = 115,6 pouces
Si vous souhaitez la conversion en pieds :
115,6 pouces ÷ 12 = environ 9 pieds 7,6 pouces.
&nbsp;
Comme convenu lors de notre appel téléphonique, je vous fais parvenir les devis #D2826 et #D2825 qui ont été envoyés pour validation. Un lien a été envoyé à votre adresse courriel pour finaliser votre achat. Nous acceptons toutes les principales cartes de crédit.
&nbsp;
Nous avons de vous offrir un rabais de 15 % pour fidélité.
&nbsp;
Nous vous remercions de nous avoir accordé votre confiance. N'hésitez pas à nous contacter pour toute question supplémentaire.
Cordialement,

Merci pour votre message.
&nbsp;
Effectivement, ce meuble est actuellement offert à prix réduit. Malheureusement, nous ne pouvons pas offrir un rabais additionnel de 15 %, car conformément à notre politique de prix et de promotion, les codes promotionnels ne s’appliquent qu’aux articles vendus à prix courant. Modifier les deux devis reviendrait au même prix.
&nbsp;
Vous pouvez consulter notre politique complète ici : Politique de prix et de promotion.
&nbsp;
Par ailleurs, nous avons joint les manuels d’assemblage à ce courriel pour vous aider dans l’installation du meuble.
&nbsp;
N’hésitez pas à nous contacter si vous avez d’autres questions.

  I opened the new replacement panels today, and both of them are damaged as well, parts&nbsp;60 and&nbsp;61. This is very frustrating, I have visitors coming on July 9th and I need to get this bed installed.&nbsp;  At this point, can I get a refund and work with what I have?

  $125 won't do it for damaged main front panels on the bed.  Can you expedite a shipment of replacement panels so I can get this installed? If the new panels come damaged, I will return the product to Costco and come up with another solution for my guests.

  I received the replacement&nbsp;panels yesterday and they are damaged as well. I am attaching photos, one is of the box on the delivery truck before it was unloaded. The other photos are of the smashed corners on both panels.  I took a leap of faith and put the frame of the bed up before these pieces were delivered, I figured the third set would be OK, I have guests coming&nbsp;tomorrow.  Where do we go from here, I don't&nbsp;want another set of panels delivered, and don't want to dismantle the unit.&nbsp; I may just build my own front.   I spoke&nbsp;to Costco yesterday, they gave me a minimal&nbsp;compensation,&nbsp;what are you willing to do? I recall your last offer was $200.   Thank you,  Frank

[2025-07-10T17:34:53.000Z] User 20745000309908: Hi Frank,
&nbsp;
I'm very sorry to hear that the replacement panels arrived damaged. &nbsp;All the compensation requests go through Costco, and they have already processed the credit to your card. &nbsp;We can not process a credit directly to you. &nbsp;Apologies for the inconvenience.&nbsp;

 I am trying to purchase these 4 of these desks for $3500 after any applicable shipping costs. I am a purchasing agent for the USAF and can provide any tax-free documentation needed upon request. I see that you have offered a 20% off coupon (USAVE20) in the past which would bring the price from $4000 to $3200 for these desks. As long as the price is $3500, that is all that really concerns me. Thank you for your time.

  I received these items at the same time, and have started assembling the closet kit. Much of the wood was damaged when we opened the&nbsp;box. We haven't opened the murphy bed but I'm worried about the pieces being in a similar condition when we begin assembly. What's your policy on this?  
  Thank you,

[2025-06-25T15:45:35.000Z] User 38460359170708: Hi Tracy,

Appreciate your follow-up. Unfortunately, nearly every wooden piece of the Closet Kit (Shelves &amp; Clothing Rods, 24W x 15D – White SKU: 125101-000017) arrived with damage. We also just unboxed the 59W Full Murphy Bed (SKU: 25183-17) and found piece #60 visibly damaged (please see attached image).

Given the extent of the damage and our need to assemble both items urgently, waiting for replacement parts isn’t feasible. I understand your team typically handles this via replacements, but I’d prefer to request a partial refund instead to compensate for the damages and avoid further delays.

Please let me know if that’s possible. I’m happy to provide additional images or information if needed.

Best wishes,  
Chelsea

OK I understand your concerns and appreciate your patience! Bestar doesn't normally do partial refunds, but yes if you are willing to keep the unit as and not ship any replacement parts then Bestar will offer you a 10 % refund in the amount of $97.75.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thanks again, for your patience!&nbsp;

Luckily, through very diligent efforts, we have managed to keep infestation low, although the number of hours spent on vacuuming, washing and safeguarding, the amount of stress and the fact that we have been unable to furnish our new home any further as we deal with this issue is still beyond disruptive. Who would have thought that purchasing new closet cabinets would lead to this?

I'm sorry but Bestar is only willing to cover 1/2 of the exterminator's cost not 100 % of the exterminator's cost. But if you want a refund for the product itself then you will need to contact Wayfair for that refund.

              I highly recommend checking more boxes. We are 100% certain these came from these boxes.&nbsp;  
  As mentioned, we have no furniture in our room, had new carpets placed only about a month ago and didn’t even have clothes in our newly built closet (new framing, drywall, electric, trim, everything). &nbsp;  
  as mentioned, I hadn’t considered the boxes at the moment that I messaged our exterminator (we have used this same man for our rental properties in the past), even in the text you can see there were only two variables—-scrubs washed from the hospital and these boxes.&nbsp;  
  My husband contacted his employer and nobody else in the facility has ever seen one.  
  We saw another bug still inside the box and two exoskeletons from inside the corrugated cardboard. They were not alive and immobile so the fact I saw them from within the package is a certainty that these came from the packaging.&nbsp;  
  There’s just no doubt about it.  
  We would like a one time treatment for bed bugs (at a minimum) before this gets out of hand and we have to seek further recourse.&nbsp;  
  Also, would like a refund on the product that we didn’t even want to being in our home for fear of spread.

Now as no bugs were found in the boxes we opened I do want to mention that Bestar will not cover 100 % of the exterminator's cost, but I'd say we will cover 1/2 of the cost!

Bestar had the location that your units shipped from open several of the same exact boxes, but that location found no bugs at all, so to resolve your issue please get an estimate from the exterminator and email me the estimate ASAP as Bestar will do a one-time exception on having the exterminator come out to spray for bugs.&nbsp;

         Hello Nicole,&nbsp;  
  It pains me to share that since I last emailed you, I never had a try at resetting the table. I had started a role in-office, and kind of let it alone. Now that I have started a new remote role and am back at home, working in my home-office, I would really love your help. Unfortunately, I tried resetting the desk, following your steps. None of that worked. I think the battery is completely dead and needs replacement. What can your team do to support me in getting a replacement so that I can continue using this desk? Using the desk helped me so much in terms of health and focus -- I was able to attach two monitors to it and had enough space for my notebook and more! Please help me - it would mean the world!  
  And in case I need to jog your memory, here is the last email I sent:&nbsp;  
  ""Hello, My standing desk had stopped functioning and I don’t know what to do. It is my absolute favorite - just the right size and has served me well since 2020. I am reaching out to see if you can connect me to a department that deals with fixing your products; Specifically, the battery is not working, and the desk is just a static desk now…I am unable to move it up and down. Here is the desk I own from Bush Furniture: Move 60 Height Adjustable Standing Desk By Bush Business Furniture Color (Top/Frame): Sand Oak/Cool Gray Metallic Size: 47.69"" H x 59.45"" W x 29.37"" D Thanks in advance for your help!!!

&nbsp; &nbsp; I am sorry to hear that the reset procedure didn't fix the issue you are having with your
desk. &nbsp;To see how we can further assist, we would need a copy of the purchase receipt for the desk as there is a warranty and we need to know if you are within that time frame.

[2025-06-15T14:45:25.000Z] User 23748015763732: Hi Nicole,&nbsp; 
  Below is the receipt from Wayfair. When I reached out to Wayfair, they had shared they no longer to business with Bush Furniture. That is why I then reached out to the Bush Furniture company directly, and got a hold of you. It’s likely that there is no warranty left for the desk. If that is the case, what are my options? I want to keep this desk and buying a brand new one is not an option.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for the invoice and I sincerely apologize that Wayfair informed you that they no longer
do business with us which is not true. &nbsp;Your desk does have a 5-year manufacturer's warranty and we
would first replace the control box and switch. &nbsp;What we first ask the consumer to perform the reset
procedure shown below at least 3 times:
&nbsp;
------ Unplug the power cord for at least 2 minutes
&nbsp;
----&nbsp; &nbsp;Plug the power cord back in
&nbsp;
----&nbsp; &nbsp;Push and hold the down button until the base travels fully down, stops, and then rises slightly
&nbsp;
----&nbsp; &nbsp;The desk should now be reset and ready for use
&nbsp;
&nbsp; If this is not successful, please let me know and I would be happy to ship the replacement parts. Can you
please let me know if the address is still the same as your receipt.
&nbsp;
Thank you
&nbsp;

  Attached is a photo of what I believe you are asking for. Let me know if this works; This was a sticker found under the table. I noticed the Model number starts with an ""H""and not a ""M"", so hoping this is correct anyways. If this is not the right one, let me know where else to look!&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for the picture however, the model and revision number I am looking for would be on a little white
square sticker on the long metal crossbar which is the bar attached to the base. &nbsp;That sticker will have the model
number that starts with the letter ""M"" and revision below that starting with ""A"" - it also could be on the legs but
mostly on that long bar.

[2025-06-19T14:30:44.000Z] User 20700130113300: Good Morning Brittney,
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for all the information and I appreciate your patience. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the replacement hardware that we would
send which is the control box and switch, is not available at this time. &nbsp;However, we will place an order to replace the full base
to your desk. &nbsp;Once the order is processed, you should receive an automatic email with the tracking number from FedEx.
&nbsp;
Thank you and have a wonderful day!

[2025-06-19T16:45:59.000Z] User 23748015763732: Thank you, Nicole. Just to be clear, the full base replacement will be the Table top itself, or the legs with control box attached? Making sure neither one that is being sent will be a different color, as the biggest appeal of this desk was the color tones that match perfectly with my home decor. -_- Sorry, I know that is very particular of me, but hope this is okay!&nbsp;  
  And the email that will be sent to me, am I to expect it to be from a FedEx email address or Solution Furniture?&nbsp;  
  Thanks!&nbsp;

[2025-06-19T16:55:56.000Z] User 20700130113300: Hello Brittney,
&nbsp;
&nbsp; The replacement that will be processed will be the exact metal frame as what you currently have. &nbsp;You will keep the top that
you have and then you would need to re-assemble the top to the new base when it arrives.
&nbsp;
Thank you

[2025-06-19T17:07:22.000Z] User 23748015763732: Understood, thank you! So this bottom part will come with the control box and switch / everything to make it move up and down properly?&nbsp;

[2025-06-19T17:08:41.000Z] User 20700130113300: Hello,
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, the new base will include everything you need to build the base with the new control box and switch.
&nbsp;
Thank you

  Thanks!

[2025-06-19T18:05:16.000Z] User 20700130113300: Hello,
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Usually, &nbsp;FedEx sends an automatic email with the tracking however, I can email you when I see the tracking number
has populated.

  Checking in this week about the delivery of my standing desk replacement. Did your team happen to receive a tracking number from FedEx?&nbsp;  
  Thanks,  Britt Vila

[2025-06-24T16:38:19.000Z] User 20700130113300: Hello Brittney,
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;I did forward the request to our further action team to process the replacement. &nbsp;I do not have the tracking number
as of yet. &nbsp;Once the order has tracking, I will send you an email confirmation.
&nbsp;
Thank you

&nbsp;
Sorry about the delay! The full Height Adjustable metal Base replacement Co # is S200796457 which should ship in a couple business days from our Erie PA warehouse to ship via Fed Ex Ground and I will advise the tracking # ASAP. Fyi - The full Height Adjustable metal Base replacement is to carry out the 5-year warranty that ends in October of 2026. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
Thanks for your patience!&nbsp;
