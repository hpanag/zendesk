# ✅ System Updates Complete

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Smart Data Caching** ✅
- Script now checks if data was already fetched today
- Only fetches new data once per day (timestamp-based)
- Subsequent runs are instant (uses cached data)
- Saves API calls and time

### 2. **Historical Data Accumulation** ✅
- All historical data is stored permanently in `execView.json`
- Data accumulates over time (never deleted)
- 90-day retention policy defined (not enforced yet)
- Full archive available for future analysis

### 3. **Dashboard Display Filtering** ✅
- Dashboards show **last 10 weekdays only**
- Weekends automatically excluded from charts
- Filtering happens in browser (all data still in JSON)
- Cleaner, more focused visualizations

### 4. **Backfill Script Created** ✅
- New `backfillData.js` script for historical data
- Fill in missing date ranges
- Weekdays only (Mon-Fri)
- Skips dates that already exist

## Quick Command Reference

```powershell
# Update data (once per day)
node execView.js

# Start dashboard server
node server.js

# Backfill historical data
node backfillData.js 2025-09-25 2025-10-05

# Force fresh data
Remove-Item data\execView.json
node execView.js

# View dashboard
# Browser: http://localhost:3000/web/dash.html
```

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Script says "data already up-to-date"
**Solution:** This is normal! Data was already fetched today.
```powershell
# To force refresh:
Remove-Item data\execView.json
node execView.js
```

### Issue: Dashboard shows fewer than 10 days
**Solution:** Not enough weekdays collected yet. Either:
1. Wait for more days to accumulate, or
2. Backfill historical data
```powershell
node backfillData.js 2025-09-25 2025-10-05
```

### Issue: Weekend data showing on chart
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. The `getLastNWeekdays()` function should filter weekends.

## What's Next?

### Recommended Setup
1. ✅ Set up Windows Task Scheduler for daily 8 AM updates
2. ✅ Keep server running during business hours
3. ✅ Bookmark dashboard: http://localhost:3000/web/dash.html
