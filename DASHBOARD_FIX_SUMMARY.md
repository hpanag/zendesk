# Dashboard Abandoned Calls Fix - Summary

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Problem
The live dashboard was showing **48 abandoned calls** when the actual count was **17 abandoned calls**.

### Root Cause
The dashboard's `LiveFeedAnalyzer.js` was using **ticket analysis** as the primary method for counting abandoned calls, which incorrectly counted:
- Tickets with "abandoned" keywords (even if calls were completed)
- Very short tickets (<30s) with no assignee
- Quick closed tickets (<60s) with no assignee
- **Tickets with status "new"** (calls still in progress!) - **This was the biggest issue**

## Solution Implemented
Modified `src/LiveFeedAnalyzer.js` to use **Voice API as the primary source** for abandoned call counts:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added Voice API Incremental Calls as primary source**
   - Fetches calls using `/channels/voice/stats/incremental/calls.json`
   - Counts abandoned calls using `completion_status === 'abandoned'` or `'abandoned_in_voicemail'`
   - This is the most accurate source available

2. **Updated fallback hierarchy**
   - **Primary:** Voice API `completion_status` (most accurate)
   - **Secondary:** Agent Activity API `calls_missed`
   - **Tertiary:** Ticket analysis (only if both APIs unavailable)

3. **Improved ticket analysis logic (fallback only)**
   - Only counts tickets with status `closed` or `solved` as abandoned
   - Excludes `new` and `pending` tickets (calls in progress)
   - More conservative keyword matching

## Results

### Before Fix:
```
Voice API:              17 abandoned calls (accurate)
Dashboard (tickets):    48 abandoned calls (inaccurate)
Difference:             +31 false positives
```

### After Fix:
```
Dashboard:              17 abandoned calls ✅
Data Source:            Voice API (Primary)
Match with Voice API:   100% ✅
```

## Verification
The fix was tested and confirmed working:
- Dashboard now shows: **17 abandoned calls**
- Data source: **Voice API (Primary)**
- Total calls: **190**
- Inbound: **186**, Outbound: **4**

## Files Modified
1. `src/LiveFeedAnalyzer.js` - Updated `getTodaysCallMetrics()` method

## Dashboard Data Location
- Live feed data: `data/live-feed-current.json`
- Dashboard automatically reads from this file

## Impact
✅ Dashboard now shows accurate abandoned call counts
✅ Uses the most reliable data source (Voice API)
✅ Eliminates 31 false positive abandoned calls
✅ Still has fallback logic for API unavailability

## Next Steps
- Dashboard will automatically show corrected data on next refresh
- No additional changes needed
- Monitor to ensure Voice API remains accessible

## Technical Details

### Voice API Incremental Calls Endpoint
```
GET /channels/voice/stats/incremental/calls.json?start_time={unix_timestamp}
```

### Abandoned Call Detection
```javascript
call.completion_status === 'abandoned' || 
call.completion_status === 'abandoned_in_voicemail'
```

This is the most accurate method as it's set by the phone system itself when:
- Caller hangs up before agent answers
- Call times out in IVR (typically 20-21 minutes)
- Caller disconnects during queue wait
