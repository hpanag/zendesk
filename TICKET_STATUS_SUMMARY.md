# Zendesk Ticket Status Verification & Dashboard

## Ticket Statuses Confirmed

Based on analysis of your Zendesk instance and the official API, the **complete list of ticket statuses** is:

1. **new** - Newly created tickets
2. **open** - Active tickets being worked on
3. **pending** - Tickets waiting for customer response or external action
4. **hold** (or "on-hold") - Tickets temporarily paused
5. **solved** - Tickets marked as resolved
6. **closed** - Tickets that are permanently closed

### What We Found in Your Instance:
- **10,000+ tickets checked** - All were in "closed" status
- Your historical data shows primarily closed tickets, which is typical for a mature support system

## New Data Added to execView.json

### Ticket Trends Section
Added `trends.tickets` with two metrics for the **last 7 days**:

1. **openTickets** - Count of tickets that became open/new/pending/hold each day
2. **closedTickets** - Count of tickets that became closed/solved each day

### Sample Data (Last 7 Days):
- **Oct 5**: 0 open, 400 closed
- **Oct 6**: 13 open, 726 closed
- **Oct 7**: 17 open, 1,064 closed
- **Oct 8**: 49 open, 804 closed
- **Oct 9**: 67 open, 503 closed
- **Oct 10**: 163 open, 868 closed

## New Dashboard: tickets.html

Created a new visualization page at `/web/tickets.html` with:

### Chart Type: Grouped Bar Chart
- **Orange bars** = Open Tickets (tickets that moved to open/pending/hold status)
- **Green bars** = Closed Tickets (tickets that moved to closed/solved status)
- **Side-by-side comparison** for easy visualization
- **Data labels** showing exact counts on each bar
- **Interactive tooltips** showing detailed information
- **Legend** at top right identifying each metric

### Why This Visualization Works:
1. **Easy comparison** - See open vs closed tickets at a glance for each day
2. **Trend identification** - Quickly spot days with high open tickets vs high closures
3. **Performance tracking** - Monitor if your team is keeping up with incoming tickets
4. **Capacity planning** - Identify peak days that need more support coverage

## Files Updated:

### 1. execView.js
- Added `generateTicketTrends()` method
- Added `getLastSevenDays()` helper method
- Updated data structure to include `trends.tickets`
- Queries Zendesk incremental API for ticket status changes

### 2. data/execView.json
- Now includes `trends.tickets.openTickets` array (7 days)
- Now includes `trends.tickets.closedTickets` array (7 days)
- Updated `metadata.kpiCategories` to include "tickets"

### 3. web/tickets.html (NEW)
- Full-page dashboard showing ticket trends
- Uses same Tabler theme as dash.html
- Grouped bar chart with orange (open) and green (closed)
- Responsive design with dark/light mode toggle

## How to Use:

### Generate Fresh Data:
```bash
node execView.js
```

### View Dashboards:
1. **Voice Calls Dashboard**: Open `web/dash.html` in browser
   - Shows answered vs not answered calls (stacked bars)
   
2. **Ticket Status Dashboard**: Open `web/tickets.html` in browser
   - Shows open vs closed tickets (grouped bars)

### Data Updates:
- Run `node execView.js` daily to keep data fresh
- Script pulls last 7 days of ticket data
- Voice data includes Oct 1-8 weekdays + today's real-time data

## Technical Notes:

### API Rate Limiting:
- Script respects Zendesk's rate limits (1 request per second)
- May skip last day if rate limit is hit (as seen in initial run)
- Can be re-run to complete missing days

### Status Classification:
- **Open tickets** = status is: new, open, pending, or hold
- **Closed tickets** = status is: solved or closed
- Counts tickets that **changed** to that status on each day

### Data Accuracy:
- Uses Zendesk Incremental Tickets API
- Filters by `updated_at` timestamp
- Captures tickets that changed status each day
- Does not double-count tickets

## Next Steps:

1. **Schedule Daily Updates**: Set up a cron job or scheduled task to run `node execView.js` daily
2. **Add More Metrics**: Can extend to show ticket priorities, channels, or response times
3. **Combine Dashboards**: Create a master dashboard showing both voice and ticket trends
4. **Add Filters**: Implement date range selectors or channel filters
5. **Export Reports**: Add CSV export functionality for executive reporting
